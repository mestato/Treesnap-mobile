body : ["While there are many different ash species present in North America, the most common include white ash, (Fraxinus americana), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), black ash, (Fraxinus nigra), and blue ash, (Fraxinus quadrangulata).", " ", "Description:", "Ash trees share several features that can be used to distinguish them from other tree species.  Ash trees have an opposite branching pattern, where buds are positioned opposite each other on twigs.  Ash trees also have compound leaves.  Compound leaves are made up of many leaflets, each of which looks like a leaf. However leaves and leaflets can be distinguished because buds are only found at the base of the overall leaf, and not each individual leaflet.  Ashes typically have 5-9 leaflets per leaf, although this varies by species.  In addition, mature ash trees have a characteristic diamond pattern to their bark and ash seeds are distinctively shaped. "]

title : "Green ash has a leaf scar below the bud while white ash has a leaf scar that wraps around the bud and is more “U”-shaped.  In addition, white ash leaflets are white-colored on the undersides while green ash leaflets are green or rusty on their undersides. Blue ash can be distinguished by its thick square-shaped twigs which are often winged.  Black ash has a leaf scar similar to green ash but leaflets are directly attached to the petiole without stalks to connect them.  In addition, black ash has a more northern range and is typically found in wet sites.",

title : "Emerald ash borer",
body : ["The reason we are looking for health ash trees is that an invasive insect, the emerald ash borer, is currently moving through North America and killing ash trees.  The larvae of this beetle feed on the inner bark of ash trees, cutting off the tree’s flow of water and nutrients and eventually killing the tree.  All American ash species are susceptible to the Emerald Ash Borer and so far there is very little natural resistance to the insect in our trees.  "]

title : "Our hope is that this reporting app will let members of the public identify ash trees that are lingering after the emerald ash borer’s arrival and which may have some natural resistance.  We will then collect seeds from these trees and add them to tree breeding programs to try and propagate resistant trees that are not killed by the emerald ash borer to use in forest restoration.",

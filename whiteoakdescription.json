title : "Description:",
body : ["American white oak, Quercus alba, is a central component of the central hardwood forests.  Mature white oaks typically grow very large, 80-100 feet high, and have broad, full canopies.  White oaks can live a very long time and some trees have been found that are over 400 years old.  ", "The leaves of white oak have alternate branching and seven to nine rounded lobes.  This is different from red oaks, which typically have pointed lobes with a small hair on each tip.  ", "It is important to note that there are several species in the “white oak” group that share this leaf shape (including swamp white oak and bur oak) and that oaks frequently hybridize, sometimes making it challenging to know which oak species you are looking at.  "]
